# Chaotic Advection

This repository contains MATLAB code used to  This repo contains functions that reproduce the numerical experiments presented in:

> H. Aref (1984), _Stirring by Chaotic Advection_, Journal of Fluid Mechanics.

It explores the **chaotic advection of passive particles** in a two-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid flow generated by a **blinking point vortex** inside a circular boundary.

_advectMapping.m_ creates and saves the positions of the advected particle array, as well as relevant info to be passed to plotting functions.

_makeAllFrames.m_ exports all frames and raw svg's.

An example usage that creates the square array experiments in Aref's paper are given in _squareTrials.m_.

## Requirements

* MATLAB **R2025a or newer**

* CLI tools for image conversion:

  * `rsvg-convert`

  * `ImageMagick (magick)`

* Windows is recommended for full compatibility with MATLAB system calls
